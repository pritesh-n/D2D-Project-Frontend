    "desc": "A movie is made by many minds but sometimes, co-incidences or lazy writing give us two very similar products. Here are 13 examples of films that twinned. \n \n The prodigious nature of the entertainment industry opens up the scope for diverse perceptions regarding the same concept. However, these perceptions often still culminate in what are known as â€œtwin films,â€ where the movies made bear similar plots and are released at a similar time. <i>Churchill</i> and <i>The Darkest Hour</i> are instances of this phenomenon. Surprisingly, this list of examples is longer than we would have imagined at first. For throughout history there have been plenty of such occasions, including the involvement of some of the biggest studios and star-casts.",

Pork Chop Marsala???????????? . Served this with some Roasted Broccolini and Cauliflower Mash. (Trying to keep the carbs low this week! Quarantine Weight Gain is real ????????????) . Ingredients: 2-4 boneless pork chops 1 cup all purpose flour 1/4 cup olive oil (or Avocado) 8 oz porcini or bella mushrooms 1/2 cup marsala wine 1/2 cup chicken stock 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 tbs minced garlic 1 diced shallot 3 tbs butter 1 tbs chicken base salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder chopped parsley 1 tsp browning (optional for darker color, as needed) . Directions: Using a meat tenderizer, flatten the pork chops until they are even (about 1/4 inch thick) â€“ You can place them between some plastic wrap and flatten them. Season the chops with salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder. Add flour to mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Lightly coat the pork chops with flour and set aside while you get your pan hot. Heat oil in large skillet and add 2 tbs butter. Add pork chops and fry for 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Remove the chops to a plate for later. Reduce heat to medium and add in mushrooms, shallots, and garlic. Season as you go. Cook this mixture for 3-4 minutes until the mushrooms are nicely browned. Pour in the marsala and increase heat to bring to a boil. Allow the alcohol to cook off a bit. Reduce heat to a simmer and add in chicken stock and cream. Add in remaining butter and mix together. Season as needed and add your chops back to the sauce. Baste with sauce and mushrooms and cover and cook until the pork chops hit 160 internal .

While the pasta is cooking, sautÃ© on low heat minced garlic and green onions in olive oil. When they soften after a couple mins, add the shrimp and season with salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper. Toss the shrimp after 2 mins and then squeeze the juice from an entire lemon. Stir to combine. By this time spaghetti should be al dente. Save 2-3 large ladles of pasta water and drain. Transfer spaghetti to the pan with shrimp. Spoon the pasta water, 1 ladle at a time. Toss well to combine everything and cook for 2 mins. Take it off the heat and serve garnished with minced parsley and grated Parmesan on top! #signatureconcoctions #pasta #lemonsauce #15minutemeals</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/signatureconcoctions/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> ????????????????????????????| ???????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????</a> (@signatureconcoctions) on Jan 31, 2020 at 8:56pm PST</p></div></blockquote> An ultimate time-saver and super tasty, shrimps are just perfect with creamy sauce.

Never to be thrown away again! I love to roast cauliflower leaves or stir fry them & like here, add them to broths and stews like you would cabbage. In the picture, Iâ€™ve used up my leftover roast chicken but if you love mushrooms, swap for mushrooms. This takes 15 minutes and is exactly what you want this week. More green soups coming up soon âœ”ï¸ Ginger noodle soup w/ cauliflower leaves Serves 2, takes 15 minutes 160g soba (buckwheat) noodles The leftover leaves from a cauliflower, roughly sliced vertically if ginormous or if the stems are very thick 1/2 tbsp coconut oil 2cm piece of ginger, finely chopped or finely grated 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 bunch of spring onions, sliced 600ml quality veg or chicken broth or stock 2 handfuls of spinach or kale/cabbage, chopped 200g shiitake mushrooms, roughly sliced or 1 handful of leftover roast chicken Sea salt & pepper 2 tbsp tamari, to taste Chilli flakes/ chilli paste/ fresh chilli to taste Squeeze of lemon or lime METHOD 1. Gently fry the ginger and garlic with most of the spring onions in coconut oil for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. (Save the rest of the spring onions for the end) 2. Meanwhile in a second pan, cook the noodles according to packet instructions & give them 30 seconds less than instructed then rinse them in cold water and set aside. 3. If youâ€™re using the mushrooms, add them to the first pan for a few minutes. Then add the stock/broth, pop the lid on and bring to the boil the immediately turn down to a medium simmer & add the cauliflower leaves. 4. If youâ€™re using kale, add them to the pan now too but if youâ€™re adding spinach, add it once the cauliflower leaves are tender after about 3-5 minutes. If youâ€™re adding leftover chicken, add with the cauliflower leaves so the chicken is heated all the way through. 5. Season with tamari, lemon juice & sea salt & pepper plus chilli if using. Add the noodles, taste for seasoning & serve straight away, topping with the last of the spring onions</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/melissa.hemsley/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> Melissa Hemsley ????feelgood food</a> (@melissa.hemsley) on Jan 15, 2019 at 4:20am PST</p></div></blockquote> Need to get rid of the spinach and kale stocked in your fridge?

Our fitness goals are no different, every new year most of us are so busy drooling over beach bods that we forget to squeeze in a workout session in our daily schedule.\n  \n  Avoiding workouts or mindful exercises is one of the easiest and common practices. Whatever your reason, you can always come up with scenarios that dig you out of the situation. Laziness, costly gym memberships, lack of interest and tight schedules donâ€™t give you the freedom to rope in physical activity in your daily schedule.\n  Having said that, there are applications that will help you stick to your resolutions without worrying about anything. For this, all you need is your smartphone and some space to workout. Here are some online applications thatâ€™ll help keep all our health goals - physical and mental - in check this year.",

I didnâ€™t share this with you guys at the time because honestly I was just trying to be okay, but I was experiencing severe anxiety. it was meditation- it was practicing every single day multiple times a day that has been healing me, and, more than just helping me manage strong emotions like anxiety and stress, itâ€™s making me a better human. not only does it help in times like this with stress and anxiety, meditation is the practice of strengthening habits like empathy, love, and compassion- making you feel more connected to not only everybody around you , but living beings in general like animals, plants, and the earth, which is a living being, itself. In times like these, especially as young people, even if we are healthy, itâ€™s important to practice compassion and help others that could be suffering. We are in this together, letâ€™s not be indifferent to others risk. itâ€™s our responsibility to do whatever it takes to keep everyone safe. Empathy to othersâ€™ reality and solidarity could make the difference in hard moments like this. We canâ€™t think that we will be unaffected because we feel young and healthy. we have parents, grandparents, friends, and neighbors, and we donâ€™t want to be a part of the problem when we could be part of the solution. So Iâ€™d like you to take 10 minutes of your day today to either look up loving kindness meditation on Calm or YouTube. Or just follow these instructions: close your eyes and sit with your spine upright and feel gravity grounding your body to the earthâ€™s surface and supporting you. Take three deep breaths and then begin to just notice the natural flow of your breath. Being aware of breathing in, breathing out. Following every inhale and exhale with your attention. Once your mind has stilled. Picture every human in the world right now, elders, people that have respiratory problems and are vulnerable, picture the people that are vulnerable, picture their families, and say â€œMay you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be free from illness. May you be well.â€ Repeat until you really feel it in your heart â¤ï¸- love you guys, please stay safe !</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/camila_cabello/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> camila</a> (@camila_cabello) on Mar 16, 2020 at 1:24pm PDT</p></div></blockquote>",

Yesterday I heard tales of crowded hiking trails and parks. Although we are all on a learning curve and arenâ€™t always perfect as we figure out this temporary new normal, we must take the orders seriously and not abuse the freedoms we still have; grocery store and essential errand runs, bike rides or walks (being disciplined about correct protocol). Itâ€™s not the time for denial. We must take this seriously and shelter in place. Itâ€™s time for nesting, reading, cleaning out closets, doing something youâ€™ve always wanted to do (write a book, learn an instrument or a language or learn to code online, draw or paint) going through photos, cooking, and reconnecting on a deeper level with the people you love. I find hope in the generosity, love, protection and care I see and feel through out our country everyday and my heart goes out to everyone directly affected or simply in fear. We will get through and I bet you our humanity will shine like never before â¤ï¸</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gwynethpaltrow/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> Gwyneth Paltrow</a> (@gwynethpaltrow) on Mar 22, 2020 at 4:44pm PDT</p></div></blockquote>",

Originating during WW1 in the Levant, it was a way of using whatever leftovers people had in the house when fresh food was hard to come by. It is a layered dish with bits of cut bread at the bottom covered with a stewed vegetable or meat and topped with a garlicky yoghurt tahini sauce. To elevate it a notch further, finish off with sizzling butter or ghee fried nuts, some chopped fresh parsley and of course some pomegranate seeds!

After all the sunshine of the past few weeks I think the rain is quite welcoming. Certainly good for the seedlings in the vegetable patch. Itâ€™s amazing how everything looks so much greener now. We made falafel on Saturday. I saved some cooked chickpeas to either make humus with or pop into a salad. Well salad took my fancy today. I popped the cooked chickpeas in a pan with a little olive oil, cumin and cayenne to warm through and absorb the spices and then add a little sprinkling of white wine vinegar. I always have spinach in my fridge, I really like it as a salad leaf, add tomatoes and avocado and a tahini dressing. Put a tablespoon of tahini in a bowl and add the juice of half a lemon and stir. It will thicken significantly so add a tablespoon of boiling water and stir to a thin pouring consistency. Season and drizzle over the salad.</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nordickitchenstories/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> ????

So much flavor, and comforting on this cold and rainy day weâ€™ve had here. Texas had me used to it being 80Â° by this time of year, but Iâ€™m not complaining! I missed this cozy and colorful spring weather. Hope everyone is doing well today. I missed everyone today in day 98464 of quarantine but am endlessly grateful for zoom dates and text threads ????

Make a crunch wrap! I was inspired by @lillieeatsandtells delicious-looking crunch wraps. They always look so tasty and as if theyâ€™re easy to grab-and-go. Check out her page for more wrap inspo and how to fold them! I took my leftover hash, pollo asado chicken, and fajita veggies and combined them in a Josephâ€™s lavash wrap along with provolone cheese, shredded mozzarella, and cilantro. Man was it YUMMY! You can find the recipes for the hash, chicken, and fajita veggies in my prior posts. Check out the recipe below for how I made a chili lime dipping sauce to go with my wrap!

The second is from @patinaandpearl and this laundry room is so bright and inviting. It almost makes you want to do laundry doesnâ€™t it? And last but NOT least is this beautiful space from @our_forever_farmhouse Every farmhouse laundry room needs a vintage looking rolling laundry cart donâ€™t you think??

(SWIPE TO SEE our laundry room make over) Let me start by saying that Erick and I live in an older home. We love it for that exact reason. It has character and charm ???? But sometimes a little paint and new hardware is the ticket ???? This quarantine has got me feeling all the feels, just like you! I am really down for a few days, then lazy, then hungry. You get the picture. But I couldn't walk past this room everyday without seeing so much potential. Plus we are in here a lot! Laundry doesn't do itself. Go figure! ???? I started this project on Thursday and I am happily enjoying the fruits of my labor this evening. It's simple, it's not some fancy bells and whistles room, but it is ours to use for now and I'm thrilled with the final look. I don't want to sound obnoxious but I encourage all of us to do something creative during this weird time. Do something productive that you can look back on, smile and feel PROUD. These are trying times mentally, physically and emotionally. But when we let our creative juices flow, you might see that this quarantine doesn't have to be ALL bad. ???? #homesweethome #homeimprovement #laundryroommakeover #mydecorvibe #beforeandafter #paintingparty #houseproject #diy #peepmypad #progresspicture #lovewhereyoulive #quarantinelife #targetdoesitagain</a></p> <p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericacoolpics/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px\" target=\"_blank\"> erica â‹’ escamilla</a> (@ericacoolpics) on Apr 15, 2020 at 4:17pm PDT</p></div></blockquote> A few posters in simple frames, a couple of planters, some fairy lights, and a somber rug is all you need for a minimalistic look.

I beveled, sanded, stained and polyurethaned ALL these gorgeous shelves and decorated (They are all built and and stained by us.) Jon helped me paint and hung the shelves PERFECTLY! He teaches me so much about #woodwork and allows me to put my hands deep in my projects. You're the BEST Babe! Next is the bathrooms and our Master Suite.

We kept the upper cabinets and just updated the hardware. Adding in the pretty tile and repainting made all the difference. We also updated the plumbing, something you canâ€™t see but allowed us to push the washer and dryer back closer to the wall, in a space this tight every inch counts. The ikea base cabinet and back shelf adds much needed storage and functionality. Iâ€™ll share the connected half bath soon, its a challenge to take pictures in. I enjoy being in and using this room so much more!

Oh laundry. Even in quarantine itâ€™s one of my least favorite chores ????. At least we can work on it throughout the day now whenever, and not all on the weekend. Also, since Ryan isnâ€™t coaching due to teaching from home, he doesnâ€™t have as many changes of clothes so there is less to do! Is your laundry load the same? More or less?

Netflix, being Netflix, altered the characters and the plot to make it their own, and we arenâ€™t complaining.
